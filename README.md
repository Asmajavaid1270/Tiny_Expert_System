# Tiny_Expert_System
Small Project
This Python program is a Tiny Expert System that determines a studentâ€™s scholarship eligibility based on their CGPA, family income, and achievements. It applies rule-based logic to decide whether the student gets a Full Scholarship, Partial Scholarship, or is Not Eligible. The program takes user input interactively and ensures valid numeric entries for accurate decision-making.
